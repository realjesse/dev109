          <img src="../images/gordon-ramsay-cooking.gif" alt="Gordon Ramsay cooking something"> One of my absolutely
          favorite hobbies is to cook!  I've cooked since I was around five or six years old.  It's been a great passion
          of mine, and it's always a relief to get away from the computer and use my hands for something else than coding!
          (We've all know that feeling in software!)
          <br>
          I've cooked a lot items, Italian, Irish, Japanese, you name it.  But some of my absolute favorite recipes
          are Italian, I love the rustic nature of the cooking, and the healthiness.  The Mediterranean diet is one of
          the most healthy in the world, and the longevity of the Mediterranean people prove it!

        <p>
          Many of my recipes have come from YouTube, there are many excellent channels out there.  But one of my
          favorite's is OrsaraRecipes.  He's a funny Italian grandpa who cooks excellent Italian food.  Every single
          recipe I've made has been fanstastic.
        </p>
        <p>
          He's got great cooking skills, but even better, amazing charm!  He's very funny and will keep you entertained
          (while you also learn!), he is all around a great chef and YouTuber.  My favorite recipe is his
